# Data Analytics Power BI Capstone Project

This repository contains my Power BI capstone project completed as part of the WerHere IT Academy Data Analytics program.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on analyzing real-world datasets to create interactive dashboards and generate actionable business insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
- Data Visualization

## Key Learnings
- Building data models for analytics
- Writing DAX measures
- Designing interactive dashboards
- Translating data into business insights
  
## Business Problem
The goal of this project was to analyze business data and transform raw datasets into meaningful insights that support data-driven decision making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes multiple tables representing key business metrics such as sales, customers, products, and time-based performance indicators. Data preprocessing and modeling were required before visualization.

## Dashboard Highlights
- Interactive filters for dynamic analysis
- KPI cards to track key performance metrics
- Trend analysis over time
- Clear visual storytelling for business users

## Key Insights
- Identified performance trends and patterns across different categories
- Highlighted key drivers impacting overall results
- Enabled stakeholders to quickly explore insights through interactive dashboards
